## 🎉 Overview
Welcome to my Bytewise Fellowship repository! This repository is part of my journey at the Bytewise Limited Fellowship program(Data Engineering Track), a 3-month immersive experience designed to provide hands-on training in data engineering. Throughout the fellowship, I will work on three industry-based projects, one project per month, to simulate real-world scenarios and build practical skills.

### 🏛️ Fellowship Structure
- **Duration**: 3 months
- **Projects**: 3 industry-based projects (1 per month)
- **Mode**: Fully remote with flexible hours

## 📊 Project 01: ETL Workflow for the World's Largest Banks Data Using Python
This project involves acquiring and processing information about the world's largest banks. It covers the entire ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, from data scraping to data visualization. Technologies used include Python, Beautiful Soup, Pandas, MySQL, and Matplotlib.

### 🔄 Workflow:
1. **Data Extraction**: Scrape data from a Wikipedia page using the Beautiful Soup Python library.
2. **Staging Area**: Save the scraped data into a DataFrame for further processing.
3. **Data Transformation**: Use NumPy and Pandas for data preprocessing, incorporating additional CSV files as needed.
4. **Data Loading**: Load the processed data into a MySQL database.
5. **Data Visualization**: Query the MySQL database and create visualizations using Matplotlib.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- Python
- Beautiful Soup
- Pandas
- MySQL
- Matplotlib
